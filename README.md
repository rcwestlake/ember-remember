# Remember

This README outlines the details of collaborating on this Ember application.

This was a week-long project built with Ember, and my first exposure to the Ember framework. It was built using agile principles, where each feature was reviewed, changed, and pushed into production before new features were started. It was a to-do app, and the focus was on Ember, not design and CSS, so it's not as pretty as I'd usually like.
